# Campus-Manager-1-file
All in one html file for campus management at Roma Tre University. 
Free or occupied status of each box is written on the url after each toggle and can be saved and restored. 
Campus status is also saved on the web with a smart use of url storage and timestamps. No databases or accounts needed.

## Project philosophy
If you decide to fork this project please keep in mind that for the use 
requested it has to stay in 1 file and not hosted on a remote server. 
It can use remote services, but always keep in mind a rollback or an 
exception handling if they're not reachable. And since it's only client-side, 
avoid using passwords or api keys. Thanks!
